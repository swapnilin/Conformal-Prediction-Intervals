# Conformal-Prediction-Intervals

Conformal Prediction Intervals provide a flexible and mathematically grounded way to estimate uncertainty in predictions. They are model-agnostic, meaning they can be applied to any predictive model, from simple linear regression to advanced neural networks, without requiring modifications to the model itself. The key idea is to create prediction intervals that are guaranteed to contain the true outcomes a specified percentage of the time, regardless of the underlying model's complexity or assumptions.

**Core Principles:**

Model Independence:
Conformal prediction works as a wrapper around any predictive model. It evaluates the model's outputs on past data and adjusts for uncertainty.
Coverage Guarantee:
If you want the prediction interval to include the true value 95% of the time, conformal prediction ensures that this happens, assuming the data is exchangeable (i.e., it has no temporal or structural dependencies).
Error Calibration:
It uses the model’s errors on past data (calibration data) to determine the width of the prediction intervals. This ensures the intervals adapt to how well or poorly the model performs.

**How It Works:**

Train-Test Split:
The dataset is split into two parts:
Training Data: To train the model.
Calibration Data: To measure prediction errors and calculate intervals.
Nonconformity Score:
For each calibration data point, the "nonconformity score" is computed. This score measures how far the true value deviates from the model's prediction.
Interval Construction:
For a new prediction, the model uses the nonconformity scores to create a prediction interval. The interval is chosen such that it covers the desired percentage of possible outcomes.

**Advantages:**

Flexibility: Works with any model and doesn't require specific assumptions about the data distribution.
Guaranteed Coverage: Ensures the desired coverage rate (e.g., 95%) under mild assumptions.
Adaptive Intervals: The intervals reflect the model's uncertainty, becoming wider for uncertain predictions and narrower for confident ones.

**Applications:**

Time Series Forecasting: Providing reliable intervals for future predictions.
Medical Diagnosis: Quantifying uncertainty in predictive models for patient outcomes.
Finance: Estimating the range of possible future stock prices or risk metrics.
Conformal prediction intervals are a robust and interpretable tool to enhance trust and reliability in predictive modeling, making them a valuable addition to any data scientist’s toolkit.
